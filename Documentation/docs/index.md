## How to use

The content of each page is a markdown file that permits simple formatting and versioning and collaboration as well.

Each page is only one markdown file. The table of contents on the left is based on h1 and h2 titles. Keep that in mind to keep the file readable and organised for the ToC to be usable.

You can find a list of all markdown features and syntax on the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">Markdown Cheat Sheet</a>.
